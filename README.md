# LoxBuddy

LoxBuddy is a convenient App to view and control your [Loxone](https://www.loxone.com/) and [LoxBerry](https://wiki.loxberry.de/start) based Smart Home.

It uses the LoxBerry [MQTT Widget](https://wiki.loxberry.de/konfiguration/widget_help/widget_mqtt) and [Lox2MQTT](https://github.com/nufke/LoxBerry-Plugin-Lox2MQTT) plugin to create a dynamic user interface with contols defined per room and category.

The plugin deploys a Progressive Web App (PWA) on your LoxBerry. Most operating systems available today offer the integration of such PWA on the start screen or direct installation as a web app.

**NOTE: The current version is not production ready. Use it at your own risk.**

## Installation

Use the standard LoxBerry plugin installation procedure to install LoxBuddy. LoxBerry 3.0 or higher is required.

Make sure you have the [Lox2MQTT](https://github.com/nufke/LoxBerry-Plugin-Lox2MQTT) plugin installed, so LoxBuddy is able to interact with your Loxone Miniserver(s) using MQTT.

More information on the LoxBuddy usage can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/nufke/LoxBerry-Plugin-LoxBuddy/wiki).
